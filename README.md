# Printigram

*Updated on 1July 2019*



Tested: Python 3.7.2 on Windows 10 Pro (will not work on other OS)

Goal: Sent text messages to [Printi](https://printi.me) by turning them into an image. 

## Issues

* Only works on Windows, because of font selection. It will work on other OS if the `fnt`-variable is deleted from lines `25` and `27`, in which case the `maxlength`-variables will also need to be updated. 
* Not fully tested yet, since printi is down until 7 July 2019.

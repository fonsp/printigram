## Printigram

About updated on 30 June 2019

Tested: Python 3.7.2 on Windows 10 Pro (will not work on other OS)

Goal: Sent text messages to [Printi](https://printi.me) by turning them into an image. 

Issues:

* Only works on Windows (because of font selection/Selenium drivers)
* [chromedrive.exe](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/.) needs to in the Python working directory
* Not fully tested yet, since printi is down.



Sample output:
